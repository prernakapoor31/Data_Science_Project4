# Sentiment Analysis of Restuarant Reviews

## Problem Statement
Nowadays, whenever a customer wants to buy a product online or book a hotel, the first thing they do is check out the reviews and ratings. People share their thoughts by writing reviews based on their experiences.
Reviews are an important part of any business because they build a business's reputation and influence consumer decisions. A business can have thousands of reviews and ratings, and it would be very hard for them to read every review. The current 5-star rating system is a simple way that provides little knowledge about customers' sentiments. There needs to be an improved way to get more precise perceptions from massive amounts of text-based data.

## Data Collection
We will collect approximately twelve thousand reviews from 150 unique New York City restaurants using the yelp.com website. We will access the data using web scraping and API. Web scraping will be challenging due to its difficulty retrieving data from complicated web page structures and IP blocking. Textual data is difficult to convert into a usable format as it contains common words, articles, and punctuations. Cleaning the textual data will also be challenging. We will classify the data to train the model.

## Machine Learning Techniques
We will use supervised machine learning techniques and Deep learning techniques to build the model. We will use tokenization and stemming for review data to understand its meaning. We will analyze the reviews, classify the data to train the model, and build a prediction model with high accuracy.

## Proposed Solution
In this project, we aim to build a business product that will predict the customer sentiments based on their reviews. The advantage of using a sentiment analysis model over a basic five-star rating system is that the model can output useful data and the sentiment classification number. As a result, this allows the enterprise to make necessary and accurate adjustments to their business operations and customer experience by improving processes. This data science product can be applied to businesses that have their businesses on yelp and uses customer review feedback, such as hotels, retail stores, restaurants, and medical practices.
We will use this model to make predictions based on new yelp data. We will deploy our model to be used with a user interface web application in the future.
